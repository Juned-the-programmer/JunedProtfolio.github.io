		<h3>Billing System (Banas Water)</h3>

		<p>
			As part of our business, we provide services related to purified water coolers. In the initial stages, managing the business was straightforward due to a limited number of customers. 
			However, as the business grew, maintaining monthly billing based on daily entries became inefficient. We faced numerous customer complaints, such as discrepancies in the number of coolers taken or billing errors. 
			These issues were affecting customer satisfaction and had the potential to harm the business in the long run. To address this, I developed a system to streamline operations and reduce complaints.
		</p>

		<p>The project is divided into three main modules: </p> 
		
		<p><strong>Customer Module:</strong>
			This module is responsible for managing customer accounts. When a new customer is registered, the system automatically sends a welcome email and generates a unique QR code for the customer. 
			This QR code simplifies the process of adding daily entries by allowing customers to scan it for quick and accurate data input.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Daily Entry Module:</strong>
			This module tracks the number of coolers taken by customers each day. Customers can easily log their entries by scanning their QR code, ensuring accurate and efficient record-keeping.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Billing Module:</strong>
			This module handles payment tracking and bill generation for all customers. It ensures that billing is accurate, transparent, and hassle-free, reducing the likelihood of disputes.</p>

		<h5>Technical Enhancements:</h5>
		<p><strong>Redis Cache:</strong> Implemented to reduce latency and improve response times.</p>
		<p><strong>Celery:</strong> Used for background tasks and automation, ensuring smooth and efficient operations.</p>
		<p><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> Implemented to archive historical data into a separate table, reducing the load on the primary database and improving performance.</p>


		<h5>Future Plans:</h5>
		<p><strong>Event Management Module:</strong> We also provide services for functions and parties. I plan to develop a dedicated module to manage these orders efficiently.</p>
		<p><strong>UI Development:</strong> Currently, the system is API-based. I aim to build a user-friendly interface using Flutter, making the system more accessible and visually appealing.</p>
		<p><strong>Open Source Contribution:</strong> Iâ€™m open to making this project open source, allowing others to contribute and learn. This is a great opportunity for developers to gain hands-on experience with real-world projects and add something impactful to their resumes.</p>
