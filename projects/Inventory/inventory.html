		<h3>Business Management System (Retailer & Manufacturer)</h3>

		<p>This project is a comprehensive business management system designed to streamline operations for both retailers and manufacturers. 
			Unlike simple applications, this system integrates multiple interconnected modules to provide a complete workflow for managing a business. 
			It eliminates the need for multiple tools by offering a centralized platform for all business operations.</p>

		<h5>Key Features:</h5>
		<p><strong>Customer Management:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Maintain detailed customer accounts, including purchase history, payment records, and interactions.</li>
			<li>Track customer behavior and preferences to improve service and build stronger relationships.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Supplier Management:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Manage supplier details, track orders, and monitor payment histories.</li>
			<li>Ensure smooth communication and transactions with suppliers.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Sales & Purchase Management:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Record and track sales and purchases in real-time.</li>
			<li>Generate invoices and receipts seamlessly.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Billing & Payments:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Automate billing processes for both customers and suppliers.</li>
			<li>Track payments, dues, and financial statements effortlessly.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Stock Management:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>For <strong>retailers:</strong> Manage inventory levels, track stock movements, and avoid overstocking or stockouts.</li>
			<li>For <strong>manufacturers:</strong> Track raw materials, monitor usage, and manage production inventory.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Financial Statements:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Generate detailed statements for sales, purchases, customer accounts, supplier accounts, and payments.</li>
			<li>Provide insights into business performance and financial health.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Role-Based Workflows:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>During signup, users can specify whether they are a <strong>retailer</strong> or <strong>manufacturer.</strong></li>
			<li>Tailored workflows ensure that each user type gets the tools they need:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Retailers:</strong> Focus on sales, purchases, and inventory management.</li>
				<li><strong>Manufacturers:</strong> Manage raw materials, production, and finished goods inventory.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Centralized Platform:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Everything from customer interactions to financial statements is managed in one place, eliminating the need for multiple applications.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Technical Highlights:</h5>
		<p>Redis Cache: Used to store frequently accessed data, reducing latency and improving system performance.</p>
		<p>Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle growing businesses with increasing data and user loads.</p>

		<h5>Technologies Used:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>- Python (Django)</li>
			<li>- PostgreSQL</li>
			<li>- Redis</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Why This Project Stands Out:</h5>
		<p><strong>Comprehensive Scope:</strong></p>
		<p>This project goes beyond basic CRUD functionality by integrating customer and supplier management, sales and purchases, billing, stock tracking, and financial statements into a single, cohesive system. 
			Unlike many beginner projects that focus on isolated features, this app mirrors the complexity of real-world ERP systems, making it a practical and ambitious solution for businesses.</p>

		<p><strong>Dual Workflows (Retailer vs. Manufacturer):</strong></p>
		<p>One of the standout features is the role-based differentiation, which tailors workflows for manufacturers (e.g., raw material tracking) and retailers (e.g., finished goods management). 
			This level of customization demonstrates a deep understanding of user needs and elevates the project beyond generic inventory tools. 
			It’s a killer feature that adds significant value and complexity.</p>

		<p><strong>Redis for Performance:</strong></p>
		<p>To address real-world scalability challenges, I implemented Redis for caching, significantly reducing latency in reporting and statement generation. 
			This optimization is often overlooked in beginner projects, but it’s a critical addition that ensures the app remains performant and responsive, even as data grows.</p>

		<p><strong>End-to-End Financial Tracking:</strong></p>
		<p>The app includes robust financial tracking features, such as payment management, customer/supplier histories, and customizable statements. 
			These aren’t just nice-to-have features—they’re essential for businesses to operate efficiently. This project isn’t just a demo; it’s a tool that solves real business problems.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Modern, Scalable Tech Stack:</strong></p>
		<p>I chose a tech stack that balances rapid development with scalability and maintainability: Django for the backend, PostgreSQL for relational data integrity, and Redis for performance. 
			This industry-relevant stack reflects a professional approach to building a solution that’s not just functional but also future-proof.</p>

		
		<h5>Why this Inventory Project Matters to me: ?</h5>
		<p>This isn’t just a "learning project"—it’s a mini-ERP system that could compete with tools like Odoo or Zoho Inventory if scaled further. 
			The fact that I am thinking about interconnected workflows (e.g., how a sale reduces stock and updates customer debt) shows maturity in designing systems, not just coding features.</p>
