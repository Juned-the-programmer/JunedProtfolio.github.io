		<h3>Terms and Conditions Reading Application</h3>

		<p>In today's life we are doing lot of transactions a day and we are accepting a terms and Conditions without reading them we will trust the person who is explaining us about that.
		<br>
		<br>
        For this application we have to create a our own dataset. So for that we have collected the dataset manually from the banks and read everything and differentiate which is against the customer.
        <br>
        <br>
		We have implemented this in React Native so we can use both in android and IOS devices easily. Used NLP(Word2vec) for model training and implementation.
		<br>
		<br>
		Used Django Rest Framework for creating a API for that project and used in the application.
		<br>
		<br>
		This is our minor project so we have worked on this project around 4 months and complete it. </p>

        <h3>Steps for the Projects are : </h3>
        <p>
            1. Take the image of the terms and conditions paper which bank will give us to sign.
            <br><br>
            2. Upload it to the Our Android Application it will extract the text from that image and store in another variable , USing Django REST framework API.
            <br><br>
            3. Give that extracted text to the NLP model which will identify which terms and conditions are against the customer and alert the customers on that.
        </p>

		<h5>Technologies:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>- Python</li>
			<li>- Django REST Framework</li>
			<li>- React-Native</li>
			<li>- Google Cloud (For hosting API)</li>
            <li>- NLP (Natural Language Processing)</li>
		</ul>

        </div>

        <br><br>
        <p>It will help the lot of people while doing the sign on the Terms and conditions paper apart from the blindly signing that.
            <br><br>
            Still we are working on that and updating the Model (NLP) to increase the accuracy of the predictions of the terms and conditions which are aginst the customer.
